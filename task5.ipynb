    "> The FBI knew who that was, and got a warrant to seize their laptop. It looks like they had an encrypted file, which may be of use to your investigation.\n",
    "> We believe that the attacker may have been clever and used the same RSA key that they use for SSH to encrypt the file. We asked the FBI to take a core dump of ssh-agent that was running on the attacker's computer.\n",
    "> Extract the attacker's private key from the core dump, and use it to decrypt the file.\n",
    "> Hint: if you have the private key in PEM format, you should be able to decrypt the file with the command openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey privatekey.pem -in data.enc\n",
    "> Enter the token value extracted from the decrypted file.\n"
